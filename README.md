# IPL-Winning-Probability
A machine learning Project on IPL Winning Probability 


## Context : 

    This project aims to predict the win probability of a team during an ongoing IPL match using historical match and ball-by-ball data. It uses machine learning techniques to estimate dynamic probabilities based on 
    real-time inputs like score, overs, wickets, and target.


## Overview : 

   • Project Type :- Classification / Probability Prediction . 

   • Libraries :- Pandas ,  numpy , Matplotlib, Seaborn , scikit-learn.


## Key Features : 

   •   Real-time win probability estimation using match context

   •    Data merging and feature engineering from two datasets

   •     Visualizations of historical match trends

   •     Machine learning model for dynamic probability output


## Steps Involved : 

   1. Data Cleaning & Merging

   2. Feature Engineering
    (current score, runs left, balls left, wickets left, run rate, required run rate, etc.)

   3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   4. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
      
   5. Win Probability Visualization.

## Results : 

   The model provides accurate probability estimates for team wins as the match progresses.

   Useful insights for sports analytics, broadcasters, and fantasy cricket apps.
